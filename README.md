Overview of the Competition
The competing Kaggle merchandise stores we saw in January's Tabular Playground are at it again. This time, they're selling books!

The task for this month's competitions is a bit more complicated. Not only are there six countries and four books to forecast, but you're being asked to forecast sales during the tumultuous year 2021. Can you use your data science skills to predict book sales when conditions are far from the ordinary?

In this notebook, we will be exploring the dataset and visualize the relationships of every column through graphs are representation.We will then preprocess the data and perform some feature engineering in order to be able to fit the train data into different machine learning models. After that, we will evaluate the models using different metrics to determine which model will perform best on the current dataset.
